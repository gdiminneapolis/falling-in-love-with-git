## Contributing

We are always looking for help in improving our training materials. We'd like your participation as well!

First, read the [Contributor Covenant](CONTRIBUTOR_COVENANT.md).

Next, you can contribute in the following ways:

* Submit an problem, suggestion, or question via [Issues](https://github.com/gdiminneapolis/falling-in-love-with-git/issues)
* Write or update a page explaining something on the project [Wiki](https://github.com/gdiminneapolis/falling-in-love-with-git/wiki)
* Fork and clone the repo, cut a branch, make your changes, and submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/gdiminneapolis/falling-in-love-with-git/pulls)

### Prerequisites

* Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (which requires [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org))

### Download

    $ git clone git@github.com:gdiminneapolis/falling-in-love-with-git.git
    $ cd falling-in-love-with-git

### Initialize

    $ bundle install
    $ yarn install


### Viewing slides while editing

    $ yarn start

This will run Jekyll in server mode, hosting output on `http://localhost:4000` -- the URL will also be displayed in Jekyll's output.

Launch your browser at that URL and you can refresh the view every time you make a change.

### Publishing to Github Pages

    $ yarn checkin

This will create the `docs/` directory which is where the slides will
be served from, commit and push all the current changes to the public repository.

The file `_publish.yml` in the root directory can be set to provide overrides and fill-ins needed for publishing on GH pages. Generally speaking, nothing needs to be done with these settings.

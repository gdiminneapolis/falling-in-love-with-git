* Meetup Description
** INTRODUCTION

Ever make changes that broke your code and forgot how your code worked
before? Want to work with someone on a code project, but aren't sure who
has the latest version of a particular file? Version control can solve
these problems and more!

[[https://git-scm.com][Git]] is a popular version control application
that can track your code changes, as well as help you to be more
methodical in your programming. Win win! This session will introduce the
basics of version control, how to use git to keep track of your changes
to a project, and using GitHub (a hosting service) to collaborate with
other developers.

*** The first part of the class will cover:

-  the basic concepts of version control
-  using SourceTree to keep track of your projects
-  how to use GitHub: pushing and pull requests

*** The second part of the class: Practice, practice, practice

The second section will be a lab where you put that new knowledge to
work by creating and working with your own GitHub project (git term:
remote repo).

- working with teams
- parallel development
- branching, merging, pull requests
- making git a habit

** INSTRUCTOR

Tamara Temple is a self-described "Webologist", Tech Maven, and deeply
interested in Software as a Craft. As a life-long learner, Tamara has
long had an interest in teaching, coaching, and mentoring people in the
arts of programming and helping people to learn how to use computers to
solve problems, communicate with others, and have a lot of fun.

Tamara works on both back-end development in Ruby on Rails, and
front-end development in AngularJS, ReactJS, and loves playing with
Bootstrap for designs using static site generators such as Jekyll. She
loves mentoring and TA'ing for the GDI Minneapolis Front End Developer
Series.

"I am deeply committed to increasing the diversity of my chosen field by
increasing the opportunities for women, LGBTQ people, people of colour,
and people with disabilities to have wonderful, rewarding, and
respectful learning opportunities."

When not working around computers, Tamara is a mom to two grown
daughters, a watercolourist, photographer, and sometime musician.

** PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE

You should be comfortable using a text editor such as Visual Code,
Atom, Sublime Text, Vim, or Emacs.

This class will not use actual code when committing to a GitHub
repository, so no need to worry about knowing a particular programming
language.

A willingness to use the command line is helpful; we will be
changing directories, listing directory contents.

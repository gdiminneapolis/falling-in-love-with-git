* Practical Git

  A session on using Git on a multi-person project.

* The Project

   - An organization, creating a web site
   - 3 sets of artifacts:
     - home page, ~index.html~
     - stylesheet, ~css/styles.css~
     - logo, ~images/logo.png~

** Form up into teams

   - 3-4 people on a team
   - Pick a team name

** Choose Roles

   - Organizer - project "owner"
   - Designer - lays out the web site visually
   - Architect - determines the structure of the code
   - Developers - everyone

   /You don't actually have to know anything about these roles for the
   workshop./

** Create an Organization

   The *Organizer*

   - creates an organization using your team name
   - invites the other team members using their Github accounts
   - creates an initial empty project ~teamname.github.io~

** Join the Organization

   The other team members:

   - check email for the invitation
   - follow invitation to team in email
   - accept invitation to join team

** Create the Project Repository

   The *Architect*

   - creates a new repository for the team project
   - add the README, .gitignore, and choose a license during the creation

** Team members clone remote

   *Everyone*

   - copy the "Clone with SSH" URL
   - use SourceTree to clone the repo locally

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <img src="images/gitcats/team-projects.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="team projects using github" />


* Work Flow

  The work flow for each step is basically the same:

  #+REVEAL_HTML: <small>
  - checkout master
  - pull remote changes to local
  - create a branch
  - do work, commit changes
  - push the branch to Github (making you the branch owner for this branch)
  - create Pull Request (PR) on Github
  - the team reviews and approves (or requests changes)
  - branch owner merges PR to master
  - branch owner delete branch
  #+REVEAL_HTML: </small>

** Step One: The Design

   The designer will create a wire frame or sketch of the web site.

   - keep it simple for this exercise
   - hand drawn is great, take pic with phone camera
   - add the picture to the repo, link to it in the README file
   - follow the work flow

** Step Two: The Architecture

   The Architect creates the project structure

   - skeleton html files, directories, skeleton css files
   - keep it simple (index, css/styles, images/logo)
   - follow the work flow

** Step Three: Fill out Site

   - The Organizer assigns work
   - Team members implement assignments
   - follow the work flow

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <small>
   Examples:

   - someone needs to find / make a logo and add it to the repo
   - someone needs to fill out the html ~<head>~ section
   - soneone needs to create some content
   - someone needs to create some CSS styles
   - someone needs to bring it all together
   - someone needs to review PRs and approve changes
   - someone needs to test the overall site

## INTRODUCTION

Ever make changes that broke your code and forgot how your code worked
before? Want to work with someone on a code project, but aren't sure
who has the latest version of a particular file? Version control can
solve these problems and more!

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a popular version control application
that can track your code changes, as well as help you to be more
methodical in your programming. Win win! This session will introduce
the basics of version control, how to use git to keep track of your
changes to a project, and using GitHub (a hosting service) to
collaborate with other developers.

### The first part of the class will cover:

* the basic concepts of version control
* fundamental git commands to track changes to a small project:
  dancing with git
* the basics of collaborating on code with other developers in a
  professional environment: banching and merging
* how to use GitHub: pushing and pull requests

### The second part of the class: Practice, practice, practice

The second section will be a lab where you put that new knowledge to
work by creating and working with your own GitHub project (git term:
remote repo).

* making git a habit
* boshing the command line: making git easier
* git problems and how to solve them
* integrating git with your editor (Sublime Text, Atom, WebStorm, Emacs)
* GUI/Desktop tools

## INSTRUCTOR

Tamara Temple is a self-described "Webologist", Tech Maven, and deeply
interested in Software as a Craft. As a life-long learner, Tamara has
long had an interest in teaching, coaching, and mentoring people in the
arts of programming and helping people to learn how to use computers to
solve problems, communicate with others, and have a lot of fun.

Tamara works on both back-end development in Ruby on Rails, and
front-end development in AngularJS, ReactJS, and loves playing with
Bootstrap for designs using static site generators such as Jekyll. She
loves mentoring and TA'ing for the GDI Minneapolis Front End Developer

and people with disabilities to have wonderful, rewarding, and
respectful learning opportunities."

When not working around computers, Tamara is a mom to two grown
daughters, a watercolourist, photographer, and sometime musician.


## PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE

This class will not use actual code when committing to a GitHub
repository, so no need to worry about knowing a particular programming
language. A willingness to use the command line is necessary; we will
be changing directories, listing directory contents, and using git
from the command line throughout the class. You should bring your own
computer to class and have administrative privileges for installing
software. Also, don't forget to bring a power supply.

## WHAT TO COMPLETE BEFORE CLASS

Please do the following in preparation for the workshop:

1. [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for a free Github account.
2. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system.
3. Ensure you have a code editor on your system. Suggestions include:
   [Atom](https://atom.io/),
   [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/download), or
   [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/). If you
   want, you can also use editors such as Vim, Emacs, Nano, Notepad++
   (not plain old Notepad.exe, though). You can get the Xcode
   development tools for the Mac if you wish. Visual Studio is
   available on Windows.

* Charger (there will be Wi-Fi and power strips available)

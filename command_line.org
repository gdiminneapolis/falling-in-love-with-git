* Get started with Command Line

| On a Mac                   | On Windows                 |
|----------------------------+----------------------------|
| Open Terminal.app          | Open Git-Bash              |
| Type ~git~ and press Enter | Type ~git~ and press Enter |


*Woo!! You've started!!*

** Anatomy of the command line

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/command-line-anatomy.png" class="" alt="command line anatomy" />
   #+END_EXPORT

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   - the /command/ is the first part on the line, after the /prompt/
   - /options/ appear after the command
     - single dash, single character options
     - double dash, multi-character options
   - /operands/ appear last, the things the command will act upon

** Commands

   The action we want the computer to take

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   - 10s of 1000s of commands
   - The first thing on the line after the promp
   - Often it's a short abbreviation
   - Sometimes there are sub-commands that follow the command
     - e.g.: ~git log~: ~git~ is the command, ~log~ is the subcommand

** Options

   - Tells the command to do something extra with the operands

   - two forms: /short/ and /long/

*** Short options

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
    - single letter
    - single dash
    - letters can be squashed together

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
    ~ls -a -l -F~ is the same as ~ls -alF~

*** Long Options
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
    - words or dash-words
    - two dashes
    - some command can have short options

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    ~git add --all --verbose~
    or
    ~git add --all -v~
** Man Pages

   Man (i.e. "manual") pages are the documentation for commands on
   Unix-based operating systems.

   To get help on the ~ls~ command, type:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
   man ls
   #+END_SRC

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   /This might also be referred to as "man-splainin'"./
** Listing files

   The ~ls~ command is used to show the files in a directory


   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     ls # -> lists the files in the current
        # working directory
     ls ~ # -> lists the files in your HOME
          # directory
     ls $HOME # -> does the same thing
     ls Desktop # -> lists the files in the
   	     # Desktop directory
     ls /usr/local/bin
   #+END_SRC

** Moving about

   The ~cd~ command changes your current working directory

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     cd # -> changes to your HOME directory
     cd ~ # -> same
     cd $HOME # -> same
     cd Desktop # -> makes the current
   	     # working directory your
   	     # Desktop
     cd Projects/GDI/classes/falling-in-love-with-git
     # -> a project directory
   #+END_SRC

** Moving and renaming files or directories

   The ~mv~ command moves and/or renames files and directories

   The form is: ~mv SOURCE DESTINATION~

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     mv file.out file.txt # -> renames the file
     mv styles.css ../sass/styles.scss
     # -> moves AND renames the file
     mv file1 file2 file3 file4 ~/Desktop
     # moves several files to your Desktop
     # directory. When moving multiple files,
     # the destination must be a directory
   #+END_SRC

** Deleting or removing files and directories

   The ~rm~ command is used to remove files and directories

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     rm file2.out # -> removes the file named
   	       # "file2.out"
     rm -rf tmp # -> recursively and
   	     # forcefully remove the
   	     # entire tmp/ directory tree
   #+END_SRC

   /Do be careful on the last one/

** Make a new directory

   The ~mkdir~ command creates directories

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     mkdir tmp #-> makes a directory named
   	    #"tmp" in the current working
   	    #directory
     mkdir -p ~/Projects/Websites/examples/full-height-flex
     # -> makes a directory under the user's
     # -> HOME directory, including all the
     # -> intervening paths if they don't yet
     # -> exist
   #+END_SRC

* Configuring your local Git

  There are some configuration items that Git requires of you.

  - Your name and email for use in commit log messages

  These are set in the "global" configuration and apply to all git
  projects on your computer.

** Set your name and email

   Enter the commands:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your.mail@example.com"
   #+END_SRC

   Replace the strings with the actual values

** Colorized output

   Git commands can have colorized output, that helps in understanding
   some of the results. To set it globally:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     git config --global color.ui true
   #+END_SRC

** Global Ignore

   Git will ignore any files and directories listed in a ~.gitignore~
   file in a project directory.

   You can also set up a global ignore file.

   #+REVEAL: split

   Enter the following into a file on if you're on a Mac:

   #+NAME: $HOME/.gitignore_globally
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     # OS/X cruft
     .DS_Store
     .localized
     .CFUserTextEncoding
   #+END_SRC

   /(Windows users probably have other files to ignore globally.).

   #+REVEAL: split

   Enter the following to configure the global ignore:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     git config --global core.excludesfile \
         $HOME/.gitignore_globally
   #+END_SRC

   #+REVEAL: split

   The following will show your current global configuration:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     git config --global --list
   #+END_SRC

   Hopefully it looks something like this:

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <pre>user.name=Tamara Temple
   user.email=tamouse@gmail.com
   core.excludesfile=/Users/tamara/.gitignore_global
   color.ui=true</pre>
   #+END_EXPORT

** Other

   There are tons of things you can configure globally, but you
   probably don't need that much.

   Each project also has a configuration, which you can use to
   override global configurations if you want.

* SSH keys
  - SSH (Secure SHell) keys are a way to secure the communication
    between your computer and another computer, /without needing to
    type a password every time./

  - You'll need a pair of keys to interact with Github (or other
    remote Git repository hosting service), a /public/ key and a
    /private/ key.

#+REVEAL: split
  - You provide the /public/ key to the remote host.

  - You keep the /private/ key /private/ -- don't share it around.

  - You can have multiple key pairs on the same machine.

  - You can use the same key pair on multiple machines.

** Check to see if you already have an SSH key pair

   SSH keys, configuration, and other information are stored in the
   root of your user directory, aka ~$HOME~, in a directory called ~.ssh~

   You may not find an existing key pair, and you may not even have a
   ~.ssh~ directory yet.

   #+REVEAL: split

   To find out, enter the following command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
   ls -alF ~/.ssh
   #+END_SRC

   If you don't have that directory yet, you'll see something like:

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <pre>ls: .ssh: No such file or directory</pre>
   #+END_EXPORT

   That's okay, we'll fix that in a minute.

   #+REVEAL: split

   Otherwise, look for a pair of files with the same base name, and
   one with an extension of ~.pub~:

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre>-rw-------   1 tamara  staff   1.6K Mar 18 18:28 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--   1 tamara  staff   397B Mar 18 18:28 id_rsa.pub</pre>
   #+END_EXPORT

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   They might be named differently than ~id_rsa~. That's only the
   /default/ name.

** Generating a new SSH key pair

   If you don't already have a key pair, or if you'd like to generate
   a new pair, enter the following:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "$USER@`hostname`"
   #+END_SRC

   - ~-t rsa~ the type of key to generate. RSA is currently unbreakable
   - ~-b 4096~ create a key that's 4096 characters, *really* secure
   - ~-C "$USER@`hostname`"~ add a comment with your user name and
     machine name (The comment can be anything, just make it memorable)

   #+REVEAL: split

   The command will run, and ask a few questions:

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   - *It will ask you where to save the new key pair.*

     - It will offer a default, but you can enter something else if
       you'd like.

     - You need to specify the directory as well, or it will save the
       key pair in the current directory.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   - *It will ask for a passphrase.*
     - You can enter something, but you will need to enter this every
       time you use the key pair, so it's like a password.

     - It is fine to leave this blank.

     - /Don't leave it blank if you're on a shared computer./

   #+REVEAL: split

   It will produce some output:

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <pre>
Your identification has been saved in xyxyxyx.
Your public key has been saved in xyxyxyx.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:GWzSrg4cpnpxRsb2Jh7Dxszz+TKRMeDs3Mk96Pqs9vE tamara@pontiki3.local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|    .  o         |
|   + .. =        |
|    B o+ o       |
|   @o+ BS        |
|  .+/.X.o        |
|  .*oOoo .       |
| .. o+*o         |
|.. .o==+E        |
+----[SHA256]-----+
   </pre>
   #+END_EXPORT
** Adding the new SSH Key Pair to Github
   The reason we just did all that is so we can securely communicated
   with GitHub. We now need to give Github our *public* key.

   #+REVEAL: split

   - copy the contents of the *public* key to your clipboard
   - open up your browser to ~https://github.com~ and log in if
     necessary
   - click on the user menu in the upper right corner (where your
     avatar is)
   - click on the ~Settings~ menu item in the dropdown
   - click on the "SSH and GPG keys" menu item on the left hand side

   #+REVEAL: split

   You'll now be in the place where you can add the new *public* SSH
   key.

   - scan the list of keys, if there are any, and see if you've
     already added this one (that's what the comments are for!)
   - click on the ~Add SSH Key~ in the upper right
   - click on the "Key" box and paste in your key
   - click on the "Add Key" button below that
   - note that the title is filled with your comment!

* The most important command

  Probably the most important command is:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    git status
  #+END_SRC

  This tells you the current state of your files and repository.

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - untracked
  - tracked with un-staged changes
  - tracked with staged changes
  - commited
  - commit difference from remote

  #+REVEAL: split
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  <img src="images/git-status-output.jpg" class="img-responsive"
       alt="screen shot showing output from a git status command" />
  #+END_EXPORT


* Creating a new project, locally
** Initialize the project directory

   The first step is called "initialization":

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     git init DIR
   #+END_SRC

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   This creates a special "hidden" directory called ~.git~ in the
   directory given in the command.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   *This is the "Index", also known as "local repository"*

** Create some content
** Stage and commit the content

*** Add changes to the stage
   You stage changes by using the ~git add~ command:

   #+REVEAL: split

   *The Git Add Command*

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     git add file1 file2 dir1/file10
     git add .
     git add --all --verbose
     git add -Av
   #+END_SRC


   #+BEGIN_NOTES
     The four commands shown above are different ways of adding to the
     local stage:

     ~git add file file file~ will add each indifividual file to the
     stage

     ~git add .~ adds new and changed files to the stage. It does
     /not/ record deleted files.

     ~git add --all --verbose~ and ~git add -Av~ do /exactly/ the same
     thing, and add all new, changed, and deleted files to the stage.
   #+END_NOTES

*** Commit local changes to the local repository
   You /commit/ your local changes to the index, aka local repository
   using the ~git commit~ command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     git commit --message "Some useful message saying what the commit is about"
     git commit -m "Some useful message saying what the commit is about"
     git commit
     git commit --add --message 'commit message'
     git commit -am 'commit message'
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   The first 2 commands do exactly the same thing. It is often easier
   to write a commit message on the command line.

   However, sometimes you want to write a longer commit message, and
   the 3rd command launches a local editor (depends on a local
   setting) that will let you craft a message as large and complex as
   you'd like.

   On Unix or Linux based systems / environments, the local
   environment variables ~GIT_EDITOR~,  ~VISUAL~ or ~EDITOR~ in that
   order determine which editor to use. It's also possible to set the
   editor in the git configuration using:

   ~git config --global core.editor "/path/to/your/fav/editor"~

   Give the full path to the editor.

   The last two forms can be used to skip the ~add~ operation. Tracked
   files with changes will be added to the stage and then
   commited. *Note* that this does not add untracked files, nor files
   that have been deleted, so you can't get away from the ~add~
   command entirely.

   #+END_NOTES

** Create the remote repository
*** From the Github Website
*** Using the ~hub~ tool
** Push the content
*** Push local repository updates to the remote repository

    Use the /push/ command to move the commits in the local repository
    to the remote repository.

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
      git push origin master
      git push --set-upstream origin master
      git push -u origin master
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    The first command simply pushes up to the /existing/ master branch
    on the remote repository, called "origin".

    You can set the upstream connection for a branch by using the
    ~--set-upstream~ option as in the second command (or ~-u~ as in
    the third command) to tell Git these branches are linked from the
    local and remote. This let's you perform subsequent pushes using
    just the command ~git push~.


    #+END_NOTES

* Creating a new project, remotely
** Create the remote repository
** Clone the remote
** Create some new content
** Stage and commit the content
** Push the content
* Tracking and Reverting Changes
** Before staging
** After staging, before committing
** After committing, before pushing
** After pushing
* Multiple Development Paths
** Branching
*** Creating a new branch

    There are two ways to create a new branch:

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
      git branch NEW-BRANCH [START-POINT] && \
          git checkout NEW-BRANCH
      git checkout -b NEW-BRANCH [START-POINT]
    #+END_SRC

*** Switching to a different branch

    The ~checkout~ operation is used to switch local working branches

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
      git checkout BRANCH-NAME
    #+END_SRC

*** Looking at local branches

    To see the branches you have locally, use the ~branch~ operation

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
      git branch
      git branch --verbose
      git branch -v
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    The first list just the branch names. The current branch is
    indicated with an /*/.

    The second and third are identical, and give more information
    about the branches.
    #+END_NOTES

*** Looking at remote branches

    Use the ~--remotes~ option

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
      git branch --remotes
      git branch -r
      git branch --remotes --verbose
      git branch -rv
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    The first two commands list just the names of the remote branches with the
    remote name.

    The second two command list the remotes with more information.
    #+END_NOTES

** Merging
** Rebasing
** Pulling Updates

   As you might expect, the inverse of the ~push~ operation to move
   commits from the local to the remote, there is the ~pull~ operation
   to pull back changes that have been made on the remote to the local
   repo.

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     git pull origin master
   #+END_SRC

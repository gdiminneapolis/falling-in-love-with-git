* What is Version Control?

  Version control allows you and your team to do /two/ very powerful
  things:

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
 - *Collaborate*

 - *Track and Revert Changes*

** Collaborate

   You can create /anything*/ with other people and be able to easily
   merge changes with each other

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
   - software
   - documentation
   - academic papers
   - books, articles, blogs
   - websites

   #+REVEAL: split

   /*/ Okay, /almost/ anything. Git works well for projects that are
   primarily:

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   - text based
   - contained in a single directory
   - don't contain a lot of large media files
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
     - movies
     - audio
     - very large images

** Track and Revert Changes

   Git gives you the ability to "go back in time"

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
   - see who made changes, when
   - track down bugs
   - see the history of the project
** Not Convinced Yet?

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
   - Employers *want* this
   - It's a *required* skill
   - It's a *standard expectation* to work in groups
     - public, i.e. opensource
     - private
   - It's personally *useful*

* Types of Version Control

  /There are basically two types:/

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - *Centralized:*
    - e.g. CVS, Subversion, Perforce
  - *Decentralized:*
    - e.g. Git, Mercurial (Hg)

** Centralized Version Control

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
   - One central source

   - Collaborators check files out

   - Work is done locally

   - Others are prevented from working on checked out files

   - Collaborators check files back in when done

** Decentralized Version Control

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
   - Local source, shared remote

   - Collaborators clone remote (fork, mirror)

   - Work is done locally

   - Others can work on same files

   - Changes are pushed to remote

   - Tools for merging conflicts
* Features of Git

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
 - *Fast and easy setup:* You can get a whole team and / or project up
   and running quickly

 - *Distributed:* everyone has their own full repository of the
   project, changes are shared through a central Depot (remote,
   origin) repository

 - *Hashed commits:* commits have unique ID ~string~ to keep track of
   when changes are made and by whom
* Working with Git
** Meet the Git Cats:
*** Git Cats
   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/gitcats/thecats.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="three cats" />
   #+END_EXPORT

*** Naming the Cats

    #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
    <img src="images/gitcats/naming-the-cats.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="naming the cats, from left to right: 'Working Cat', 'Index Cat', 'Remote Cat'" />
    #+END_EXPORT

*** The Stage

    #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
    <img src="images/gitcats/the-stage.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Staging: getting the cats ready" />
    #+END_EXPORT

*** Dance Step 1: Adding
    #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
    <img src="images/gitcats/dance-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Dance Step 1: adding the cats to the stage" />
    #+END_EXPORT

*** Dance Step 2: Committing
    #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
    <img src="images/gitcats/dance-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Dance Step 2: commiting the cats to the index" />
    #+END_EXPORT

*** Dance Step 3: Pushing
    #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
    <img src="images/gitcats/dance-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Dance Step 3: pushing the cats to the remote" />
    #+END_EXPORT

** Creating repositories

   Creating a /local/ repository starts with having a /local/ working
   directory.

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/gitcats/working-dir-cat.small.jpg" class="centered-image" alt="" />
   #+END_EXPORT

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
   - it can be empty
   - it can already have files

** Initialize the index

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<img src="images/gitcats/index-cat.jpg" class="img-responsive"
     alt="a cat representing the git index" />
#+END_EXPORT

** The Stage

#+REVEAL_HTML: <img src="images/gitcats/the-stage.jpg" class="centered-image" alt="" />

** Stage changes

#+REVEAL_HTML: <img src="images/gitcats/add-to-stage.jpg" class="centered-image" alt="" />

** Committing changes

#+REVEAL_HTML: <img src="images/gitcats/commit-to-local-repo.small.jpg" class="centered-image" alt="" />

** Creating the remote

   Before you can push changes, you need to create the remote repository
   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/gitcats/remote-cat.jpg" class="img-responsive"
        alt="cat representing the remote repository" />
   #+END_EXPORT

   You usually create the remote on the GitHub website (or whereever
   you store your remote repositories.)

*** The remote name

    By convention, and this almost never changes, the remote
    repository is known to the local repository as /"origin"/.

    It doesn't have to be, but it's the default most tools and other
    users assume.

** Pushing changes

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/gitcats/push-to-remote.small.jpg"
        class="img-responsive"
        alt="image showing flow of changes from local repo to the remote repo " />
   #+END_EXPORT

** Branching and Merging
   ... allows us to work on different parts of the project at
   the same time without interfering with other work.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   ... is also useful for trying experiments without breaking
   existing code


*** ~master~ is the /default/ branch
   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/gitcats/cat-master-branch.small.jpg"
        class="img-responsive"
        alt="image of cats depicting commits on the master branch" />
   #+END_EXPORT

*** make a branch for a new feature
    #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
    <img src="images/gitcats/cat-feature-branch.small.jpg"
         class="img-responsive"
         alt="two lines of cats showing commits on the master and feature branch" />
    #+END_EXPORT

*** try an experiment on the feature
    #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
    <img src="images/gitcats/cat-exp-feature-branch.small.jpg"
         class="img-responsive"
         alt="image of cats on the master branch, feature branch, and an
         experimental feature sub-branch" />
    #+END_EXPORT

*** oops, need to hot-fix master
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<img src="images/gitcats/cat-hot-fix.jpg" class="img-responsive"
     alt="image of cats on master with a hotfix" />
#+END_EXPORT

*** have to merge back to feature
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<img src="images/gitcats/cat-hot-fix-pre-merge.jpg"
     class="img-responsive"
     alt="cats showing extra pre-merge from master to feature because
     of hot fix" />
#+END_EXPORT

*** the repository merge index

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<img src="images/gitcats/branching-cats.jpg" class="img-responsive"
     alt="image of cats depicting commits on master, feature,
     experimental and hot-fix branches" />
#+END_EXPORT

** Rebasing

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   - Rebasing is a complicated topic, it takes some time to understand
     what's going on.
   - It's like merging, except not exactly.
   - Sadly, this is where SourceTree falls down.

     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
     - it's incorrect
     - it's interface is confusing
     - So we're not covering it today

* Getting Git Software

  Most systems come with some version of Git installed, but it's
  usually best to work with the most recent (or close to recent)
  version.

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  Git itself is primarily a /command line tool/

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  There are also two good GUI tools that you can do most of what
  you'll learn today.

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - /SourceTree/
  - /Github Desktop/

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  We'll be working with *SourceTree* today

** Install Git

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <div>
     <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads"
        alt="Download latest version of Git"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
       <img src="images/install-git.jpg" alt="Download latest version of Git">
     </a>
     <br>
     <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads"
        alt="Download latest version of Git"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
       git-scm.com/downloads
     </a>
   </div>
   #+END_EXPORT

** Install SourceTree

   An alternative to /most/ of the command line git tools

   Download from:




   [[https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/][SourceTree Download]]

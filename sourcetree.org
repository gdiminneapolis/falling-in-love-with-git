  Objective: Create a new local project with SourceTree

  #+REVEAL_HTML: <small>

  1. From the bookmarks window: New -> Create Local Repository
  2. Provide it a path, i.e., the folder where your project will be
     created.
     - Use the "..." button to navigate to the place you want your project
     - Create a new folder that will be the name of your project
  3. The project name is automatically filled in.
  4. Make sure you're creating a Git repository.
  5. Make sure to check the "Also create remote repository" checkbox
  6. Click on create
  7. Create the remote
     - Fill in the description if you wish
     - Make sure the "private repository" checkbox is *not* checked

  #+REVEAL_HTML: </small>

* Creating a New Project, Remote First

  If you want to go the other way, you can start by creating the
  remote repo first.

** Create the Remote Repo

   #+REVEAL: split

   Start creating the remote repo

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/new-repo-remote-first/01-click-new-repository.png" >

   #+END_EXPORT

** but it's still empty...

* Let's Develop It!

  Objective: create a new project from the remote side

  #+REVEAL_HTML: <small>

  1. From the bookmarks window: New -> Create Remote Repository
  2. Git the repo a name and description.
  3. Make sure "private repository" is *not* checked.
  4. Create the remote.
  5. Click on "Remote".
  6. Search for your repo.
  7. Click on "Clone".
  8. Give the path to the new repo. (The last folder and the project
     name should match.)
  9. Click "Create"

  #+REVEAL_HTML: </small>

* Create some content

  Fire up your editor and create a ~README.md~ file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC markdown
    # Hello World!

    This is the README file for this repository.
    It doesn't matter for this class what you put here.
    It's going to look different in the rest of the slides.

  #+END_SRC

** Check on the status

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/new-repo-local-first/07-created-some-new-content.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" />

** See local branches

   At first, SourceTree hides the local branches, so tell it to show
   them

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/new-repo-local-first/10-see-local-branches.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
   #+END_EXPORT

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/new-repo-local-first/12-back-on-github-first-commt.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
   #+END_EXPORT

* Let's Develop It!

  Objective: Put some content in our project and put it under version
  control

  #+REVEAL_HTML: <small>
  1. Open the project file in your editor.
  2. Create a README.md file, and put something in it.
  3. Save the file.
  4. Switch back to SourceTree.
  5. Stage the file.
  6. Commit and push the changes.
  #+REVEAL_HTML: </small>

* Tracking and Reverting Changes

  A great feature of Git is that it lets you erase any changes you've
  made in a step to get back to the original.

  #+REVEAL: split

  You can recover from changes made:

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - before you add the changes to staging
  - after adding but before committing the changes to the local repo
  - after committing to the local repo but before pushing to the
    remote
  - after pushing to the remote

** Before staging

   If you've made some changes to try something out but you decide to
   abandon them, SourceTree makes this easy

*** discard hunks

    #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
    <img src="images/sourcetree/tracking-changes/discard-before-staging.jpg"
         class="img-responsive"
         alt="screenshot of sourcetree showing change status of README.md file" />
    #+END_EXPORT

** After staging, before committing

   After you've staged your changes, but before you commit them,
   SourceTree can also recover these.

   #+REVEAL: split

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/tracking-changes/revert-to-commt.jpg"
        class="img-responsive"
        alt="revert to commit" />
   #+END_EXPORT
** After committing, before pushing

   Make some changes, and let's commit them.

*** commit the changes

    #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
    <img src="images/sourcetree/tracking-changes/commit-a-change.jpg"
         class="img-responsive" alt="committing a change" />
    #+END_EXPORT

*** select the commit to revert

    #+REVEAL_HTML: <img src="images/sourcetree/tracking-changes/revert-commit-select-commit.jpg" class="img-responsive" />

*** select "Reverse commit" from drop-down

    #+REVEAL_HTML: <img src="images/sourcetree/tracking-changes/revert-commit-select-revert-change.jpg" class="img-responsive" />

*** after the revert, a new commit

    #+REVEAL_HTML: <img src="images/sourcetree/tracking-changes/revert-commit-after-revert.jpg" class="img-responsive" />


** After pushing

   Even if you've pushed to the remote, you can fix things.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   However, since your teammates may have pulled your changes, you'll
   need to make a new commit and push those changes. (sorry)

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   This is to prevent discrepancies between the indexes in the various
   repositories.

*** A better way

    Since you can't very easily erase changes in a remote (pushed)
    repository, the better way to develop projects is with branching
    and merging.

* Let's Develop It!

  Objective: Try out making and reverting changes.

  No directives here, just try out the various options shown prior.

* Multiple Development Paths

  Work on multiple versions at the same time with:

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Branching
  - Merging


  #+REVEAL: split

  Creating a new branch to work on a feature or bug,

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  <img src="images/gitcats/cat-feature-branch.small.jpg"
       class="img-responsive"
       alt=""/>
  #+END_EXPORT

  and then merge it back into the regular development branch


* Branching

  To make a new branch from an existing branch, click the "Branch"
  button:

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  <img src="images/sourcetree/branch-button.png" class="img-responsive"
       alt="SourceTree branch button" />
  #+END_EXPORT

** Give the branch a name

   In the dialog, enter the new branch name:

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/new-branch-name.png" class="img-responsive"
        alt="Entering the new branch name" />
   #+END_EXPORT

   Leave the "Working copy parent" and "Checkout new branch" options selected.

** Create the new branch

   Press then "Create Branch" button.

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/branching-and-merging/01-create-new-branch.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
   #+END_EXPORT

** Your new branch

   In SourceTree, the current working branch is highlighted.

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/branching-and-merging/02-new-branch-highlighted.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
   #+END_EXPORT

** Make some changes

   After you make some changes, SourcTree reports uncommitted changes

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/branching-and-merging/03-uncommited-changes.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
   #+END_EXPORT

   Select the checkbox next to the changes you want to stage (or all)

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/branching-and-merging/05-stage-changes.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
   #+END_EXPORT

** Commit the changes

   Click on "Commit" to start the commit proess

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/branching-and-merging/06-commit-changes.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
   #+END_EXPORT

** Review, comment, and commit

   Review the changes, add a commit message, and commit.

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/branching-and-merging/07-commit-message.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
   #+END_EXPORT

   Check the "Push" checkbox to also peform the push to the remote

** Output from push

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/branching-and-merging/08-push-output.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
   #+END_EXPORT

** After the commit and push

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
   <img src="images/sourcetree/branching-and-merging/09-after-commit-and-push.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
   #+END_EXPORT


* Let's Develop It

  Objective: Create a branch and push changes to it

  #+REVEAL_HTML: <small>
  1. Create a new branch.
  2. Create a new file in the branch with some content.
  3. Check the status in SourceTree.
  4. Stage, commit, and push the changes in the branch.
  #+REVEAL_HTML: </small>

* Merging
  #+REVEAL_HTML: <img src="images/gitcats/merging-cats.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="" />

  #+REVEAL: split
  - When you're finished working in the development branch, you'll
    want  to merge those changes with the master branch.

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Since the master branch may have also been updated, you need to
    first pull changes to master and merge with your development
    branch.
  - Resolve any conflicts that may arise.
  - Finally, Merge your development branch with master.

** Merging with no conflicts

*** A new branch with a file
